# BCI-Project
Research project at the California Institute of Technology, June 2022 - Present

Pipeline for a functional ultrasound-based decoder for a real-time, minimally invasive brain-computer interface (BCI).
Determined the minimum size of ultrasound image needed for beamforming (processing and SVD clutter filtering) without affecting decoder accuracy for the purpose of increasing decoding speed.
